Hi! I'm Benjamin, or Ben for short! My passion for computer science began in high school when I took my very first programming class. For the final project, we were given the task to create a game in C++. We were given a few weeks to work on it. My group decided on battleship, and we finished game in about a week, giving us two weeks to spare. Instead of taking it easy though, we decided to go above and beyond. We figured out how to add sounds for hits and colors for the water to the terminal, but that wasn't enough. Our goal became to add Towers of Hanoi, and then we held our own mini competition to create Blackjack. Despite already having secured a good grade on the project, I spent the extra time learning and implementing new possible features and doing extra work. No other class allowed me the freedom to truly problem solve and express my creativity like this one. Homework, somehow, became fun. 

I went on to attend Michigan State University for undergrad, where I pursued a bachelor's in computer science and a cognate, essentially a minor, in business. My computer science classes were by far the hardest that I took while in undergrad, but they were also the ones I enjoyed the most. From this point on, I knew I wanted to be a software engineer. I finished out my 4 years with 4.0s in all of my 400 level cse classes, including being a part of an amazing team for my capstone project, which won the award for the best overall project. From all this work, I was able to get accepted to the master's program at the University of Michigan. 

Education, and computer science, while important to me are not the only things I care about. To me, it is very important to be a well-rounded person and I find the ability to communicate and simply be a pleasant person, to be as important as how to perform a depth first search or reverse a linked list. To keep myself rounded, I prioritize my other interests. I enjoy spending time with my friends every week, gaming with the ones that are too far to visit, playing sports or watching them whenever possible, and learning about new topics, like when I decided to replace the window motor in my car beacuse I thought it would be a fun learning experience.

Thanks for reading a bit about me!
