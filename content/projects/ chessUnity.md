For my computer graphics final project, we were allowed to decide what we wanted to do. I chose to create a chess game in unity. Part of the project was a tutorial I followed, and then part was my own additions. Overall this was my first time coding in C# and in a game engine, so I learned a lot about assets and working in a 3D space. I had a lot of fun with this, and tried to go above and beyond for it.
