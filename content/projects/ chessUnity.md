For my computer graphics final project, we were allowed to decide what we wanted to do. I chose to create a chess game in unity. Part of the project was a tutorial I followed, and then part was my own additions. Overall this was my first time coding in C# and in a game engine, so I learned a lot about assets and working in a 3D space. I had a lot of fun with this, and tried to go above and beyond for it. 

The parts I implemented beyond the tutorial, learning Unity, and C# were to allow for the castling move, a skybox and additional lighting, new cameras and a camera for each players turn, and implementing a different chess asset pack from the Unity store.

Overall I learned a lot about using game engines and 3D modeling and spaces, and could definitely see myself using Unity in the future for more personal projects!
