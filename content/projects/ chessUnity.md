For my computer graphics final project, we had to create something involving lighting. I chose to extend a chess game in unity. To create the logic for the game itself, I followed a tutorial. The tutorial left me with a board and movable pieces. The remainder of the project was my own additions. 

I added a skybox, seen in the picture above. I updated the cameras for each player's turn, to give them a view from behind their pieces. New dim lighting to give the nighttime feeling was also added. Finally, I added functionality for a castling move, which in short allows for a castle to swap places with a king.

This was my first time coding in C# and in a game engine, and I learned a lot about assets and working in a 3D space. I had a lot of fun with this, and tried to go above and beyond. 

Overall I could definitely see myself using Unity in the future for more personal projects!
