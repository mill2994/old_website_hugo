[GPA Calculator](http://webdev.cse.msu.edu/~mill2994/gpa/index.php)

During my junior year of undergrad, I realized that it would be possible for me to graduate with Honor, a GPA of 3.82 or higher. At the time I had around a 3.78, so it was not going to be easy with less than half of my classes left and many of the more advanced classes left, but worth the challenge. The problem was, I wanted to know what I needed to get in my classes senior year, but could not find a calculator where I could input grades on a .5 scale and then input my current GPA along with my remaining credits, and then my target final GPA. Being a computer science student, I built it myself. I realized using this that senior year I would be able to get about two or three 3.5s and the rest would have to be 4.0s. In the end it did not end up mattering very much, as I 4.0d all of my classes senior year, and 16/17 final classes overall, but it motivated me to stay focused and to achieve the goal that I set for myself.

I also implemented a cumulative GPA calculator, that would update your cumulative GPA based upon new grades that you input. Which me and my roommate found to be useful as well.

I decided to host it on the cse servers available to me as a student at MSU, and so I am not sure how long that will actually be up for, but at the time of writing this, it is still running. There is also no CSS on the page outside of a little formatting, as my focus was mainly on having a working and accessible calculator, which was a success.
