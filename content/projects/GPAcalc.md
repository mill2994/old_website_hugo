During my junior year of undergrad, I realized that it would be possible for me to graduate with Honor, requiring a GPA of 3.82 or higher. The problem was, I wanted to know what I needed to get in my classes senior year, so I needed to be able to input my current GPA, remaining credits, and final GPA to then get the GPA I needed for those remaining credits. For example, if I took 60 credits and have 60 more to go, and have a 3.5 and want a 3.75 then I would need a 4.0 average in the remaining classes. 

Being a computer science student, I decided to build it myself. I created some forms which would take the necessary data, and when submit, the program performed the necessary calculations. I also hosted the program so that I could access it from my phone whenever and my roomate could utilize it as well.

Using this I discovered that senior year I would be able to get two or three 3.5s and the rest of my classes would have to be 4.0s. In the end it did not matter very much, as I 4.0d all of my classes senior year, and 16/17 final classes overall, but it motivated me to stay focused and to achieve the goal that I set for myself.

I also implemented a cumulative GPA calculator, that would update your cumulative GPA based upon new grades that you input, beacuse I struggled to find a version online which used grades on a .5 scale (4.0, 3.5, 3.0, etc.).

I decided to host it on the cse servers available to me as a student at MSU, and it currently appears that the buttons are no longer able to be used unfortunately. There is also no CSS on the page outside a little formatting, as my focus was mainly on having a working and accessible calculator, which was a success.
