For the final project in my Algorithm Engineering class, I got to conduct research on some of the popular algorithms and data structures, and these were the results of the 4 different experiments! (In PDF's)

- [Binary Tree v Hashtable](/BinaryTreevHashtable.pdf)
- [Hybrid Sorting](/HybridSorting.pdf)
- [Multiset v Vectors](/MultisetvVectors.pdf)
- [Quicksort v Insertion sort](/QuicksortvInsertionsort.pdf)
