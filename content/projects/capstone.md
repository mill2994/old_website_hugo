For my computer science capstone course at Michigan State, I worked with the Anthropocene Institute to help create the Wildfire Risk Forecasting Tool. The goal for the project was to create an educational, open source, and easy to access tool for forecasting current and future wildfires. The web app features a plotly map and a form. The form contains preset scenarios or adjustable options. The fire then gets plotted onto the map, and real life impacts are calculated. The project went on to win the Amazon Sigma Award, given to the top overall capstone project, out of the 30 total.
