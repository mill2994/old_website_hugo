For my computer science capstone course at Michigan State, I worked with the Anthropocene Institute, founded by Carl Page, to create the Wildfire Risk Forecasting Tool. The group decided that the goal for the project was to create an educational, open source, and easy to access tool for forecasting current and future wildfires. The web app features a plotly map and a form, as well as additional pages to learn more about wildfires. The form contains preset scenarios or adjustable options. These options include wildfire relevant data like humidity, temperature, and wind direction. Once the run button is hit, the fire is plotted onto the map, and real life impacts are calculated. These impacts include data like lives possibly lost, damage to houses, air quality impacts, and more. I personally worked on the front end which includes the inputs to the simulator, the costs from the resulting fire, and information for homeowners to learn more about what they could do to prevent the simulated fire from becoming a reality.

The project went on to win the Amazon Sigma Award, given to the top overall capstone project, out of the 30 total projects. I kept this post shorter, as the hosted web app below has the full project available, including a 10-minute video about the project for those who are interested! However, as of my last visit in May 2024, it appears the current servers no longer handle the program as well as previously.

Finally, the project is dedicated to Richard Chan, our sponsor and mentor, who passed away unexpectedly during the creation of our project. He pushed us to create something truly meaningful.
