I wanted to learn more about machine learning, so I created a program that labeled whether a picture was of a pancake or a waffle. The program achieves around 90% accuracy for the labeling. Due to having a relatively small data set, I used data augmentation to help avoid overfitting. Overall, the biggest thing I learned was that having a good dataset for machine learning was just as important as the code and algorithms used.

To help solve my problem that I faced gathering a dataset, I used a google image web scraper. The web scraper is able to download nearly all the images of a specified search term automatically by using Selenium. Using this tool allows me to get a decent sized data set of around 700 images, and all I have to do is type in my search term.

Overall, while knowing the difference between a pancake and a waffle is not world changing, I learned a lot, and was able to problem solve to find a solution to gathering easy data sets.
