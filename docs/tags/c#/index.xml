      <description>For my computer graphics final project, we had to create something involving lighting. I chose to extend a chess game in unity. To create the logic for the game itself, I followed a tutorial. The tutorial left me with a board and movable pieces. The remainder of the project was my own additions.
I added a skybox, seen in the picture above. I updated the cameras for each player&amp;rsquo;s turn, to give them a view from behind their pieces.</description>
