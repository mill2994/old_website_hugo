      <description>BenBot is a discord bot that I created for my server with my friends. I decided to make my own bot so that I could have full control over how it worked, and I would be able to implement the features that I really wanted. Plus, if AI ever take over, it can&amp;rsquo;t hurt to have one as my son. All jokes aside, BenBot is currently capable of recording cold takes, sending messages at specific times, listening for and responding to key words, saving to and accessing a database, using threading to keep track of date and time, and responding to specific users or channels, with updates coming regularly.</description>
