      <description>With this project I decided try something new. I wanted to create something me and other people would be able to use daily, that would provide utility. BenBot was my answer! BenBot is a discord bot that I created for my server with my friends. I decided to make my own bot so that I could have full control over how it worked, and I would be able to implement the features that I really wanted.</description>
