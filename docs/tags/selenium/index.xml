      <description>I wanted to learn more about machine learning, so I created a program that labeled whether a picture was of a pancake or a waffle. The program achieves around 90% accuracy for the labeling. Due to having a relatively small data set, I used data augmentation to help avoid overfitting. Overall, the biggest thing I learned was that having a good dataset for machine learning was just as important as the code and algorithms used.</description>
