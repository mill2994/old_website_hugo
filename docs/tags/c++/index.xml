      <description>For the final project in my Algorithm Engineering class, I chose to conduct research on some popular algorithms and data structures, and these were the results of the 4 different experiments!
My most notable takeaway was that I learned about the concept of collisions for hash tables from my results being much slower than expected. These reports were from early on in my experience with data structures and algorithms, and looking back at it now in 2024 the results seem pretty straight forward, but they helped me learn a lot at the time.</description>

      <description>For the final project in one of my 300 level CSE classes at MSU, we were to create a simpler version of the popular Bloons Tower Defense Game. I no longer have access to the code, but I still wanted to talk about some features that the game had, and what I learned.
The game featured multiple levels, the layouts of which were contained in XML files. These files stored the tile type and location.</description>
