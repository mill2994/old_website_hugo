      <description>For the final project in my Algorithm Engineering class, I chose to conduct research on some popular algorithms and data structures, and these were the results of the 4 different experiments!
My most notable takeaway was that I learned about the concept of collisions for hash tables from my results being much slower than expected. These reports were from early on in my experience with data structures and algorithms, and looking back at it now in 2024 the results seem pretty straight forward, but they helped me learn a lot at the time.</description>
