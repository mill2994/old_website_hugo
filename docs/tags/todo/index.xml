      <description>My next big project I plan to work on is a tool to assist in learning guitar. I haven&amp;rsquo;t nailed down exactly what specifications I want for it yet, but some possibilities are flash cards of different cords and the ability to add more, the ability to have these flash cards pop up in random order, ability to hear the cord played to be able to compare, the ability to create songs by placing cords at timestamps and then playing that back to learn songs and make my own, a somewhat nice looking UI, and a daily streak tracker.</description>
