        <p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Ben! I am currently an aspiring software engineer. I graduated from Michigan State University in 2022, and currently attend the University of Michigan where I am pursuing my Masters in Computer Science and Engineering. My passion for computer science began in high school when I took my first programming class. For the final project we were tasked to create a game in C++ and were given a few weeks to work on it. My group finished our battleship game in about a week, and instead of taking it easy and being content with what we had, we decided to go above and beyond. We figured out how to add sound and color to the terminal, and when that wasn&rsquo;t enough, we added Towers of Hanoi and held our own mini competition to create Blackjack. That project helped make me into the person I am today, and was the beginning of my strong work ethic and passion for computer science.</p>
<p>I am a pretty easy going person, who excels at working in groups or independently. I spent a lot of time working in retail and have a cognate in business, so working with and communicating with different people has always been an interest and strength of mine. I pride myself on being reliable and effective in my work, my life and all things I wish to accomplish.</p>
<p>I created this site using Hugo to display some of my notable projects that I have worked on. I hope you see something that catches your eye! Thank you for visiting!</p>
